# Advent Of Code

Junior's First Advent of Code :)

# Thoughts:

**Day 1**:
* Day 1 went pretty well. Most of my time was spent trying to figure out how to split the the text properly. Using just `\r\n` would split every number but I wanted to split it so each item in the array was the group of numbers. I finally figured out that I needed to do `\r\n\r\n`. Moving forward from them was pretty easy

* Learned:
    * I watched Rank 1's vid and I didn't think to spread my array into `Math.max()` to get the answer for part 1.
